target = 210q on cf
topic - numbertheory and bitmanipulatijon

string z algorithm,kmp algorithm,rabinkarp algorithm,trie
USE STACK  whenever the involvement of  find the larger or smallest element of next or previous element happen
PERMUTATION Whenever in case of printing always print the conditional first and then rest of remaning
SUM OF ELEMENT [L,R] (L+R)*(R-L+1)/2;
PREFIX FOR AND
current d1000 lets do this shit after 5months 
Simple liner dp are important, subarray or cout the pairs etc 
IN PAIR COUNTING i==j  || Nc2 || n*(n-1)/2 ||  (i-1)+(i)+(i+1)+(i+2) -> - <-FOR THE SAME KIND IG
If operation on whole array think about the GCD 🤡
If finding any index related thing in sorted array alway think first upper bound or lowerbound
Think about the even odd for case >1 or >2 or <5 etc..
For query first check Is the order matter for the answer or not
For Tree or Graph if somewhere distance terms smells try thinking bfs or dijisktra.
IF two or three nums are given find out the relation between them.
no of digit  =  log10(N)+1
find max or min value = andha binary search
lamda function format 
	auto ok = [&](int parameters) -> return value {
			// kuch karo be
	};

Terniary Search
	m1 = l+(r-l)/3;
	m2 = r-(r-l)/3;

Bitmanipulation property
a+b = a|b + a&b
a|b = a^b + a&b
put braces around the bitwise operation

break and check the value of integer for particular cases 
you need to become more specific about the target 
try to use multiset in two pointers
